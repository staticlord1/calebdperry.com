## Installation

### New Grav site

1. Download the latest release in this repository.
2. Unzip the package into your web root folder.
3. Access your site via web browser.

### Existing Grav site

You can just install [Clean Blog theme](https://github.com/tranduyhung/grav-theme-clean-blog), but page content will need to reference the Clean Blog theme's supported templates. It is strongly advised to at least install the Clean Blog skeleton package to see the theme's capabilities in action.

To install  **just** the theme:

```
$ bin/gpm install clean-blog
```
